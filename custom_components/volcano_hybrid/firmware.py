"""
Firmware version tracking for the Volcano Hybrid.

The vaporizer cannot report whether a newer firmware exists; only Storz &
Bickel's web app knows that, by asking their server. Rather than make every
installation call out to that server, the newest firmware known at release
time is recorded here and compared against what the device reports.

`.github/workflows/firmware-check.yml` polls the vendor endpoint on a schedule
and opens an issue when it disagrees with `LATEST_KNOWN_FIRMWARE`, which is the
signal to test the new firmware and bump the constant below. That keeps the
integration itself free of any network dependency.
